The Foundation will use its best endeavours to verify that the person requesting the information is a healthcare provider or emergency services personnel who require immediate access to the Member Information in circumstances where you (or the Member, if you are applying on behalf of another person) are unable to provide it.</p>\r\n<p>5.7 Without limiting any other provisions of these Terms and Conditions, you release the Foundation from any claim by you or for any liability:</p>\r\n<p>a) for loss or damage sustained by you or any other person, arising directly or indirectly as a result of the provision of the Member Information to any person or organisation, if the Member Information is incomplete or inaccurate or out of date due to any act or omission on your part; or</p>\r\n<p>b) if the Member Information is provided to a person or organisation without your consent, provided that the Foundation has reasonable grounds for believing that it was in your interest for the Member Information to be released to that person or organisation, in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>\r\n<p>5.8 If you are making an Application as the parent or guardian of the Member, any reference to &quot;<strong>you</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>your</strong>&quot; in this document is also a reference to the Member unless the context otherwise requires, and you warrant and represent that you are authorised to complete the Application on behalf of the Member and that the information provided is complete and accurate.

Use of Foundation Products</em></p>\r\n<p>6.1 The release of the Member Information to a healthcare provider or emergency services personnel in a medical or other emergency depends on the healthcare provider or emergency services personnel being aware of your Membership emblem.</p>\r\n<p>6.2 You will find information on the Site about how you should wear or display your Membership emblem. It is important that you follow those recommendations. The Foundation devotes considerable effort to promoting awareness amongst healthcare providers and emergency services personnel that in an emergency situation they should check the wrist or neck of a person for evidence of Membership of the Foundation. If the Membership emblem is not displayed in accordance with the recommendations of the Foundation it will greatly reduce the likelihood that the emblem will come to the attention of a healthcare provider or emergency services personnel in an emergency.</p>\r\n<p>6.3 While the Foundation uses all reasonable endeavours to promote and continue awareness of the Foundation amongst healthcare providers and emergency services personnel it does not warrant that even if a Membership emblem is worn in accordance with the recommendations on the Site, it will in every emergency situation be detected by the relevant personnel.</p>\r\n<p><em>7. Annual Members - Service Fee &amp; Information Update</em></p>\r\n<p>7.1 If you are an Annual Member, an annual service fee payable by you, commencing on the date of your Membership joining date.

Each year you will receive an Annual Renewal Notice setting out the amount payable by you to maintain your Membership, the payment methods available and a copy of your Member Information held on file. This is the time to review all of your details for accuracy and inform the Foundation of any changes required. If you do not pay the fee due and payable by you to the Foundation and confirm or update the information held by the Foundation in respect of you, the Foundation will no longer consider you to be a Member of the Foundation, and will take all necessary steps to delete the Member Information it holds in respect of you. The Foundation will use its reasonable endeavours to notify you of any imminent deletion of the records and information it holds in respect of you, to give you a final opportunity to re-commence Membership, but you understand, acknowledge and agree that the Foundation is under no obligation to do so, and can delete the information it holds about you without further notice.</p>\r\n<p>7.2 The Terms and Conditions applicable to obtaining and maintaining Membership of the Foundation and/or use of the Site may be changed by the Foundation without notice, and such amendments will be effective from the date specified by the Foundation. Submission of an application for Membership, and payment of your annual Member service fee, is acceptance of these Terms and Conditions as varied from time to time.</p>\r\n<p><em>8. Life Members - Information Update</em></p>\r\n<p>8.1 If you are a Life Member, each year you will receive a copy of your Member Information held on file. This is the time to review all of your details for accuracy and inform the Foundation of any changes required. If you do not contact the Foundation every year to confirm the accuracy or update the information held by the Foundation in respect of you, the Foundation will no longer consider you to be a Member of the Foundation, and will take all necessary steps to delete the Member Information it holds in respect of you. The Foundation will use its reasonable endeavours to notify you of any imminent deletion of the records and information it holds in respect of you, to give you a final opportunity to re-commence Membership and status as a Life Member, but you understand, acknowledge and agree that the Foundation is under no obligation to do so, and can delete the information it holds about you without further notice.</p>\r\n<p>8.2 If you are a Life Member and require your information to be updated by the Foundation, a small administrative fee will be payable (the precise amount will be specified in our correspondence). Payment should accompany the form indicating the required changes.</p>\r\n<p>8.3 The Terms and Conditions applicable to obtaining and maintaining Membership of the Foundation as a Life Member and/or use of the Site may be changed by the Foundation without notice, and such amendments will be effective from the date specified by the Foundation.

Placing an order for Products</em></p>\r\n<p>9.1 You may order Products by submitting your order in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.</p>\r\n<p>9.2 Any order placed for a Product (whether through this Site, by placing a telephone order or returning a completed order form) is an offer by you to purchase the particular Product for the price notified (including the delivery and other charges and taxes) at the time you place the order, which can be accepted or rejected by the Foundation as specified in clause 10 below.

Acceptance or rejection of an order</em></p>\r\n<p>10.1 We will accept or reject orders in our discretion. If we accept an order, this results in a separate binding agreement between you and the Foundation for the supply of those Products requested in your order, on these Terms and Conditions to the exclusion of all others. For each order accepted by us, we will:</p>\r\n<p>a) supply the Products to you in accordance with these Terms and Conditions; and</p>\r\n<p>b) for orders placed via the Site, we will send you an automated email confirmation of that order &ndash; though with the nature of the internet we cannot guarantee that you will receive this. Please add the Foundation email address (orders@medicalert.org.au) to your contact address book to ensure emails are not sent to your junk email folder, or blocked by your fire wall or other security settings.</p>\r\n<p>10.2 In certain circumstances, the Foundation may reject your order. Rejection of an order is in the Foundation&#039;s absolute discretion, for reasons including but not limited to the Product not being available or if there is an error in the price or the Product description posted on the Site.</p>\r\n<p>10.3 If we are unable to accept an order, then we will endeavour to notify you of that at the time you place the order or within a reasonable time afterwards. We may in our discretion invite you to submit an order for an alternative Product, in which case clauses 9 and 10 will apply to your new order.</p>\r\n<p><em>11. Delivery of Products</em></p>\r\n<p>We deliver Products Australia-wide using Australia Post&#039;s standard delivery services (unless specified otherwise). Products valued over $160 are generally sent via Australia Post&#039;s registered post service (some exclusions apply). Please allow approximately 20 working days for delivery using Australia Post&#039;s standard delivery services. Other timeframes for delivery will apply if delivery method is different. We only deliver Products ordered to addresses in Australia. If you require delivery to an international address, please contact us to arrange this.</p>\r\n<p><em>12. Cancelling an order</em></p>\r\n<p>12.1 We may cancel any part of an order (including any orders that we have accepted) without any liability to you for that cancellation at any time prior to delivery of Products to you if:</p>\r\n<p>a) the Products are not available; or</p>\r\n<p>b) there is an error in the price or the product description for the Product; or</p>\r\n<p>c) that we reasonably believe your order has been placed in breach of these Terms and Conditions.</p>\r\n<p>If we do so, then we will endeavour to provide you with reasonable notice of that cancellation, provide you with a suitable alternative Product, and will not charge you for the cancelled order (and will refund any payment you have made to us).</p>\r\n<p>12.2 Subject to clause 12.3, you may cancel an order by contacting Membership Services during Business Hours within 24 hours of placing your order. Upon cancelling the order, the Foundation will refund your payment either to your original payment method or through an alternative means selected by us, less an administration fee of $20.00. You cannot otherwise cancel an order.</p>\r\n<p>12.3 Orders for customised Products cannot be cancelled by you once the Product is in the manufacturing stage.</p>\r\n<p><em>13.

MedicAlert Foundation has adopted this Privacy Policy to ensure we handle personal information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles (&quot;<strong>APPs</strong>&quot;) set out in Schedule 1 of the <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> (Cth) (&quot;<strong>the Act</strong>&quot;). The APPs are a common set of requirements that regulate the handling of personal information by both Australian government agencies and businesses.</p>\r\n<p>More specifically, the APPs set out the way organisations such as MedicAlert Foundation can collect, use, disclose and provide access to personal and sensitive information. Personal information is specifically defined in the Act, and refers to any information that identifies or could identify a person, whether it is true or not. It includes, for example, your name, age, gender and contact details. Personal information can also include sensitive information (another specifically defined term in the Act), which is information about your health and health services provided to you. We are also bound by the Australian Direct Marketing Association Privacy Code for direct mail activities.</p>\r\n<p>The privacy of our members&rsquo; personal information is important to us and we conduct our business with the highest standards of personal and corporate integrity. We aim to provide the best possible service, whilst ensuring you are aware of how your personal information is used within MedicAlert Foundation.</p>\r\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all employees, consultants, contractors and agents of MedicAlert Foundation, and covers all information collected on the MedicAlert Foundation website as well as information supplied to MedicAlert in person, by phone, in writing (including email) or in any other way.</p>\r\n<p><em>1. Collection of Personal Information</em></p>\r\n<p>We will always be open and honest in our dealings with you and will only collect information about you that we believe is necessary to undertake our legitimate business activities. We will always collect your personal information by fair and lawful means (for example when you complete an application form, in person, online or by telephone). Most often we will collect your personal information directly from you or your doctor (where we have obtained your consent to do so).</p>\r\n<p><strong>1.1 Type of Information<br /></strong>Member&rsquo;s personal information is collected through information provided by you (or your representative for purposes of joining the Foundation) and is stored on your current membership file. The information may include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>your name, date of birth and membership number;</li>\r\n<li>your mailing address, contact number(s), email address(es) and emergency contact details;</li>\r\n<li>information on any health conditions and personal needs you may have, together with details pertaining to your doctor&rsquo;s name, address and where your hospital records are kept;</li>\r\n<li>your credit card details (as required to execute the payment of membership fees and purchases);</li>\r\n<li>information on the products and services we have provided to you;</li>\r\n<li>a record of any queries you have made; and</li>\r\n<li>transactional history relating to your usage of our services.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We also collect sensitive information about you such as medical conditions, allergies, medications taken, blood group and other such relevant information (e.g. special needs and requests), and store this on your membership file.</p>\r\n<p>We will only collect any other personal information, including sensitive information, in accordance with the Act.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1.2 Cookies<br /></strong>The MedicAlert Foundation website and its pages use software known as &lsquo;cookies&rsquo; to record your visit to our website and collect some statistical information.

Use and Disclosure</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>2.1 Collection and Use of Information<br /></strong>MedicAlert Foundation collects personal information directly from you wherever possible, however sometimes we may collect personal information about you from a third party, e.g. a friend who has provided your details to us so we can send you a membership form, or your doctor where you have consented to us communicating with him/her.</p>\r\n<p>Any personal information collected about you is used for the following purposes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>to contact you directly about MedicAlert Foundation&#039;s activities, special offers and other promotions;</li>\r\n<li>to reward you for being a loyal member;</li>\r\n<li>to approve transactions you wish to make;</li>\r\n<li>to confirm your identity;</li>\r\n<li>to provide you with products and services you have requested;</li>\r\n<li>to follow up or pursue any queries you make;</li>\r\n<li>to conduct consumer research;</li>\r\n<li>to notify you of the outcome of specific promotions;</li>\r\n<li>to service and administer your membership entitlements; and,</li>\r\n<li>to ensure you are aware of various membership benefits and to offer specific products and services we consider may be of particular interest to you.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>2.2 Disclosure and Use of Information by Third Parties<br /></strong>Any information collected by MedicAlert Foundation is kept strictly confidential and is only accessed by authorised MedicAlert Foundation staff, agents, contractors or service providers with whom we have a contractual agreement, in the course of them undertaking their legitimate duties in providing a given product or service.</p>\r\n<p>If your membership of MedicAlert Foundation lapses or is cancelled by you voluntarily, we will not disclose your information except in the circumstances outlined below, and will take steps to delete your information from our system.</p>\r\n<p>Member or customer information will not be disclosed to any external third party organisation except as set out in this document, and will only be made available to an outside entity where:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>MedicAlert Foundation has contracted an external service provider (under strict privacy terms) to assist in the execution of MedicAlert Foundation&rsquo;s activities;</li>\r\n<li>MedicAlert Foundation is acting as an agent or representative of another entity;</li>\r\n<li>the purpose of disclosure to the third party is related (or, in the case of any sensitive information (as defined in the Act), directly related) to the primary purpose for which the information was collected;</li>\r\n<li>there exists a permitted general situation (as specifically defined in the Act) in relation to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information to the third party;</li>\r\n<li>a permitted health situation (as specifically defined by the Act) exists in relation to the collection, use or disclosure of health information;</li>\r\n<li>if disclosure is required by or authorised by law; or</li>\r\n<li>if you consent to the disclosure of specific information.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em>3. Anonymity</em></p>\r\n<p>It is your choice to provide information to us. Wherever it is lawful and practicable, you have the option not to identify yourself when interacting with us. You can remain anonymous when using some parts of the MedicAlert Foundation website and its pages.</p>\r\n<p>However, it may be necessary for us to collect your personal or sensitive information if you would like to access certain materials or services we offer. If you choose not give us the information we require, we may not be able to provide the services you have requested.</p>\r\n<p><em>4. Data Quality</em></p>\r\n<p>MedicAlert Foundation will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete and up-to date. However the accuracy of that information depends to a large extent on the information you provide. That&rsquo;s why we recommend that you contact us and:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>let us know if there are any errors in your personal information; and</li>\r\n<li>keep us up to date with changes to personal information such as your name and address.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Each year you will receive a copy in the mail of your medical information (sent with your annual subscription fee, if you are required to pay this to maintain your membership) that you can use to check your details are accurate. If you do not pay your annual fee (if applicable) and confirm the accuracy of your information, or advise us of any changes, we will no longer consider you a member of MedicAlert Foundation, and will delete information we hold in respect of you. We will use all reasonable steps to notify you before we delete your information, to give you one final chance to recommence membership and provide us with current information.</p>\r\n<p><em>5. Data Security</em></p>\r\n<p>MedicAlert Foundation will take appropriate steps to protect your personal and sensitive information and keep this information secure. This includes physical security, computer and network security, communications security and personnel security.</p>\r\n<p>We will request sufficient identification to permit authorised access to the existence, use or disclosure of members&rsquo; personal information when required, as per our Operating Standards and Emergency Management Call Protocol. Any such identification information shall be used only for this purpose unless we have your consent to use or disclose it for other purposes.</p>\r\n<p>If we no longer require your personal information, including if your membership lapses (including as a result of you not contacting the Foundation annually to confirm the personal information we hold about you, or request that we update the personal information we hold about you), or, is cancelled by you voluntarily, we will take reasonable steps to either destroy the information we hold about you in a secure manner or remove identifying features from the information. We will however, retain basic details such as your name and date of birth to enable us to advise any future callers that we no longer provide services to you. This is also subject to any legal obligations we have to keep information for a certain period of time.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5.1 Order and Pay Online Securely<br /></strong>Our online payment systems use encryption technology to ensure your credit card and contact details are kept safe and secure when transmitted across the internet. This makes it very difficult for third parties to intercept and misuse your details but, as with all internet transmissions such as internet banking, there always remain some risks. We take all reasonable steps to minimise these risks and will notify you as soon as we reasonably can if and when we become aware of any unauthorised access of your personal or sensitive information via the internet.</p>\r\n<p><em>6. Marketing</em></p>\r\n<p>MedicAlert Foundation complies with permission based direct marketing requirements under the Act and the <em>Spam Act 2003</em> (Cth). When collecting your personal information, we will request your permission to use that information to send you information on products and promotions or other health-related materials and will give you the opportunity to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; of receiving such marketing material. Where you indicate your consent, MedicAlert Foundation may enter your details into a database for the purpose of contacting you directly about our brands, special offers, consumer research and other promotions.</p>\r\n<p><em>7. Access and Correction of Personal Information</em></p>\r\n<p>We will take reasonable steps to ensure that all personal information that we collect, use or disclose is accurate, up-to-date, complete, relevant and not misleading. Please see Section 4 above, for the part you play in assisting us with ensuring this is the case.</p>\r\n<p>MedicAlert Foundation respects the rights of individual members and customers to access and correct their own personal information that is in our possession. Simple access requests can usually be actioned over the telephone by asking for the Privacy Officer on <span class=&quot;AVANSERnumber&quot;>1800 88 22 22</span> (Monday &ndash; Friday 9am &ndash; 5pm CST) as per our Operating Standards. However detailed requests may need to be submitted in writing addressed to the Privacy Officer at:</p>\r\n<p>MedicAlert Foundation<br />GPO Box 9963<br />In Your Capital City</p>\r\n<p>or by email sent to: <a href=&quot;mailto:enquiry@medicalert.org.au&quot;>enquiry@medicalert.org.au</a></p>\r\n<p>We will respond to your request to access or correct your personal information, or to withdraw your consent, no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of such requests. If for any reason your request is refused, we will give you a written notice that sets out the reasons for refusal and how to dispute the decision.</p>\r\n<p><em>8. Transfer of Information Overseas</em></p>\r\n<p>By providing personal and/or sensitive information to us, you consent to the transfer of that information to any jurisdiction in which we conduct our business activities, for the purpose of enabling us to provide services to you. With effect from the date of this Policy, this includes transfer by us into the United States of America and disclosure to MedicAlert Foundation United States, Inc (MedicAlert US), for the purposes of including your information in MedicAlert US&#039;s database to enable worldwide provision of services to you outside of Australia as needed. You can at any time remove your consent to the disclosure of your information to MedicAlert US and inclusion in its database, by contacting our Privacy Officer using the contact details set out in Section 7 above.</p>\r\n<p>We will otherwise only transfer your personal or sensitive information overseas if the transfer is to you or to one of your authorised representatives (including your treating medical practitioner located overseas), with your express consent or otherwise in accordance with the Act. We will not send your information outside of Australia in any other circumstances.</p>\r\n<p><em>9.

Perhaps move away in embarrassment and decide it&rsquo;s time to leave?</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;These behaviours and physical symptoms are often the signs that someone is about to have or is having an epileptic seizure,&rsquo;&rsquo; MedicAlert Foundation Chief Executive Officer Heidi Jones said.</p>\r\n<p>At the start of national Epilepsy Awareness Month, and in support of its Go Purple awareness campaign, Ms Jones says there is low community awareness and understanding about epilepsy.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Research suggests that due to the social stigma and misconceptions associated with epilepsy, many people do not disclose their condition,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is of great concern to us as it may mean that people do not get fast and effective emergency treatment.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Melbourne resident, Emma Gaffy, 31, knows firsthand the misconceptions surrounding the condition and lack of knowledge about how to deal with an emergency situation.</p>\r\n<p>As a result and in preparation for overseas travel, Ms Gaffy recently obtained a MedicAlert medical identification bracelet.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had some very difficult experiences over the years, including in 2006 I was on the Gold Coast shopping alone and had a seizure in a store,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said. &ldquo;I had no time to warn anyone and the store staff were completely unsure of what to do. Then in 2007 I was in Venice and collapsed and had a seizure. Even the hospital staff weren&rsquo;t sure what was going on during it, even though my sister tried to explain.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I feel a lot safer now with the MedicAlert medical ID and I know that if anything happens, it&rsquo;s there and it can speak for me, if I can&rsquo;t.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Ms Gaffy was diagnosed with tonic clonic epilepsy, as a result of a brain haemorrhage and stroke when she was only 19. Aside from a five minute warning just before the stroke &ndash; a tingling sensation down her right side &ndash; she had no warning signs.</p>\r\n<p>She spent six months in hospital following the stroke and needed 24/7 care to learn to walk, talk and function again. During this time, she had multiple seizures, but now with daily medication she has few seizures a year, but lives in constant fear of having a seizure and is unable to get her driver&rsquo;s licence.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Jones said a MedicAlert medical identification bracelet or necklace plays a critical role in informing first responders in an emergency that a person has a medical condition, particularly when someone is not able to communicate.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;A medical ID can save lives and in the case of children with epilepsy, they also give parents great peace of mind that if something happens when your child is not in your care, they have the protection of a medical ID.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not only are paramedics and healthcare professionals trained to look for the MedicAlert emblem, they can also call the the 24/7 emergency hotline for further important medical and personal details, held on its secure national database.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Epilepsy facts from Epilepsy Action Australia:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>According to the World Health Organisation, epilepsy is the world&rsquo;s most common serious brain disorder. It is not a mental disorder;</li>\r\n<li>Approximately 25,000 people in Australia are diagnosed with epilepsy each year;</li>\r\n<li>An estimated 800,000 people in Australia will be diagnosed with epilepsy at some stage in life;</li>\r\n<li>An estimated 250,000 Australians are living with epilepsy and</li>\r\n<li>It is commonly thought that epilepsy always involves convulsions.

Of course there are other means you may need along the way, such as bribes, threats, moral persuasion, parental authority and anger, but when it comes to getting them to wear their medical ID, your first &lsquo;go to&rsquo; should be routine.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Mother of three Rebekah Smith said that for her two girls (aged 9 and 15) who wear a medical ID &ndash; the biggest problem is remembering to have them on when they go to school or their friend&rsquo;s places to play, because sometimes they take it off for sports practice or to wash.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;To combat this, at the breakfast table each morning we initially created a placemat for each child &ndash; the teenager didn&rsquo;t love it of course - with a list of the things that they need to do every morning, one of which is put their bracelet on,&rdquo; said Mrs Smith.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;They both know it&rsquo;s important, we&rsquo;ve educated them about what could happen if they were to suffer an allergic reaction and no one was around who knew about their condition; so it&rsquo;s not about convincing them, it&rsquo;s about making sure they have the ID with them if emergency strikes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;As you might expect the older one was reluctant to think that she needed reminding every day with a placemat, so we told her she could schedule it in her phone, but if we saw her not wearing her ID, then it was back to the placemat. I think she likes the sense of independence,&rdquo; said Mrs Smith.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Huffington post writer and father of two, Kevin Harnett, says &lsquo;routines are typically neat and clean and easy to manage once you invest the time to get them up and running&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Fellow writer and mother of a 6-year-old with severe food allergies to eggs, milk, peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish and melons, Missy Voronyak said it was easier to get her daughter used to wearing the bracelet while she was young.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;</strong>Most of the medical ID jewellery on the market is meant to be worn 24/7 &mdash; including while sleeping and bathing. It took less than a week for my daughter to get used to wearing her bracelet. Now we barely notice it,&rdquo; said Mrs Voronyak in her blog on <a href=&quot;http://marketingmama.com/5-reasons-children-with-food-allergies-should-wear-medical-id-jewelry&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Marketing Mama</a>.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked with families who wait to introduce medical ID jewellery until a child starts school and then face a battle of wills with the child. Many children end up wearing them only during the school day and then end up forgetting it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I like having it as a regular part of our lives, not a <em>special </em>thing we have to remember. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t even think to remove it during our family portraits recently &ndash; and that&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>As for what type of jewellery your child is most likely to put on and keep on, Mrs Voronyak believes the more traditional metal bracelets sit closer to the skin and fit more snugly on the wrist so the wearer usually doesn&rsquo;t notice it is there.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;My hunch is that children are more compliant with wearing a traditional metal bracelet because of this,&rdquo; said Mrs Voronyak.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I often hear two phrases in the food allergy world: 1) My child&rsquo;s been wearing a (metal) medical bracelet since they were diagnosed and never take it off! and 2) My child won&rsquo;t keep their bracelet on, they keep taking it off. The more traditional bracelets usually go on and stay on.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Of course each person and situation is different, so you need to do what works for your family,&rdquo; said Mrs Voronyak.</p>\r\n<p>With a host of fashionable new designs frequently being released Mrs Voronyak says there&rsquo;s no excuse that medical IDs &lsquo;don&lsquo;t look cool&rsquo;, and with an abundance of technology to assist us in remembering just about anything, MedicAlert are encouraging parents to sit down with their children and work out the best way of ensuring everyone is covered if the worst should happen.<br /><br /><br /></p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,999,'Getting your kids to do important stuff, like wearing their medical ID',NULL,NULL,1,0,0,0,0,'/uploads/news-and-resources/images/medic-alert-logo.jpg',NULL,NULL,'2016-04-01','0000-00-00',NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,'2016-07-08 20:18:46','2018-01-31 07:13:08',NULL),(21,34,10,1,6,'Men',NULL,NULL,'men',0,'<p>Whether it&rsquo;s everyday wear or a special occasion, we offer a range of men&rsquo;s medical jewellery to suit all needs.

But still he endured, and as he woke up to realise he couldn&rsquo;t walk, talk, read, write, understand what people said, remember or even taste, it was evident that Tom&rsquo;s life would never be the same again.</p>\r\n<p>Nine years on and Tom&rsquo;s will to live life to the fullest has seen him fight to regain much of what he lost, including re-enrolling in university, travelling the world and becoming the Co-Chair of &lsquo;Talkback&rsquo; which is the peak body for people living with aphasia in South Australia.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Aphasia is a loss of language skills caused by stroke or other brain injury and continues to be one of the greatest challenges in my life,&rdquo; Tom says.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;In South Australia there are about 10,000 people living with aphasia, and yet it remains a very misunderstood and unknown disorder, largely because those with it struggle to communicate.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As someone with a number of complex and potentially life-threatening conditions, Tom says a MedicAlert membership was a simple choice that gave both he and his mum peace of mind.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to have to stop doing the things I loved, like travel, study and attending social outings, but I also knew that I would be in danger if an emergency struck and the people around me weren&rsquo;t aware of my medical history,&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;As someone who deeply understands the importance of being able to communicate clearly, it&rsquo;s great to know that even if I was caught in an emergency overseas, my medical details would be made available to the people treating me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Tom says he is looking forward to an upcoming trip to Europe, and feels that extra layer of confidence knowing that the MedicAlert emblem is recognised worldwide.</p>\r\n<p>To find out more about the Talkback Association for Aphasia head to <a href=&quot;http://www.aphasia.asn.au/&quot;>http://www.aphasia.asn.au/</a></p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,999,'Thomas Bunning',NULL,NULL,1,0,0,0,0,'/uploads/testimonial-3.png',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,'2016-08-19 10:02:45','2016-10-01 03:58:27','2016-10-01 13:28:15'),(54,170,4,0,104,'Robert Tunbridge',NULL,NULL,'emily-ahrens',0,'Craigmore, SA, member since','If I were to collapse or need assistance the paramedics can tailor their response to my needs accordingly and these details are on my alert bracelet.

They suggested I get my affairs into order as there was no cure except transplant, and of the three (heart and liver) transplants they had attempted with my condition none had survived.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>With few options worth considering, Robert and his wife jumped on a plane to Sydney to find out whether he was an eligible candidate for a transplant.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;After 10 days of testing I was put on the transplant list, and the long wait began,&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was put on the list in July 2012 and in February 2013 I got a phone call from one of the transplant coordinators saying that they had a heart for me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;My wife and I were on a plane within two hours and that day I went under the knife for the heart transplant surgery.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Despite the operation not quite going go to plan and his recovery being extremely slow, Robert remains one of the few surviving heart transplant patients in Australia with Amyloidosis.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;While doctors would normally aim to transplant both the heart and liver for Amyloidosis patients, they feared the risks of attempting this were far too great, and focussed on getting my new heart working correctly,&rdquo; Robert says.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Despite a number of near death experiences and &lsquo;Australian firsts&rsquo; being required just to keep me alive, I was discharged nine weeks later with a new lease on life thanks to an extraordinarily selfless individual, whose heart I will literally never forget.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Robert says one of the first recommendations provided by his transplant team was to join MedicAlert Foundation, so that his unique condition would be made available to treating medical staff in an emergency.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If I were to collapse or need assistance the paramedics can tailor their response to my needs accordingly and these details are on my alert bracelet. Thankfully I haven&rsquo;t had to use my MedicAlert bracelet yet, but I definitely feel safe knowing that I have this in a time of need,&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n<p>While Robert continues to deal with a number of obstacles, he remains optimistic about life and is working to assist doctors in finding a cure for the defective amyloid gene.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I have already been the guinea pig with some of the procedures and drugs I&rsquo;ve taken to date, so if I can help others benefit from my journey then that would be a great outcome.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>To share your story via our newsletter email your interest to <a href=&quot;mailto:sharemystory@medicalert.org.au&quot;>sharemystory@medicalert.org.au</a>.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,999,'Robert Tunbridge',NULL,NULL,1,0,0,0,0,'/uploads/testimonial-4.png',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,'2016-08-22 13:03:35','2016-10-01 03:34:02','2016-10-01 13:03:50'),(55,171,4,0,104,'Denise Mascaro',NULL,NULL,'denise-mascaro',0,'Dubbo, NSW, member since 1990','Emergency workers and health staff see my MedicAlert medical ID around my neck and they take notice of it &ndash; I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times it has saved my life','<p>Most of us have encountered an idling bus or truck and inhaled a lungful of unwanted diesel fumes and were left feeling sightly queasy.

She has undergone allergy testing to try to pinpoint the triggers.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I had no reaction to any of the placebos and had differing grades of reactions to a range of other materials. One thing I didn&rsquo;t react to at the time was MSG (monosodium glutamate), which was a surprise to everyone involved,&rdquo; she says.</p>\r\n<p>That surprise turned to horror later that night when Denise suffered a delayed and very severe reaction that would give her a second near-fatal experience.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I carry my MedicAlert card with me at all times and when I was rushed to hospital they saw it and went straight into resuscitation mode, which again saved my life.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Exactly what triggers an anaphylaxis reads like a who&rsquo;s who of daily dangers and includes regularly prescribed antibiotics and a number of other drugs, latex, artificial colourings and preservatives, and of course, diesel fumes, to name a few.</p>\r\n<p>While Denise jokes that she lives a hermit lifestyle these days, the serious reality is that when it comes to going outside her home, it&rsquo;s often just too much of a risk to take.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go to the movies, I avoid people wearing strong perfume, I don&rsquo;t eat food prepared by someone else, and soap and garden aisles in the supermarkets are no-go zones for me,&rdquo; Denise says.</p>\r\n<p>With the severity of reaction dictated by her exposure to a certain trigger, it was the danger of not being able to tell people her condition in an emergency that sparked Denise to research for a trusted way to alert health authorities.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;MedicAlert membership was the best solution for me and I know that if I become unconscious then someone coming to my aid can make a correct assessment and give me the life-saving adrenalin that I need,&rdquo; she says.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I have one daughter who is a nurse and another who is a radiographer, so I am in good hands when they are around, and my MedicAlert emblem helps me when they are not.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Emergency workers and health staff see my MedicAlert emblem around my neck and they take notice of it &ndash; I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times it has saved my life.&rdquo;</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,999,'Denise Mascaro',NULL,NULL,1,0,0,0,0,'/uploads/testimonial-5.png',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,'2016-08-22 13:05:33','2016-10-01 03:37:19','2016-10-01 13:07:06'),(56,172,4,0,104,'Darrin Burgmann',NULL,NULL,'darrinburgmann',0,'Nowra, NSW 2016','&ldquo;Chances are I could be found in just about any state - unconscious due to low blood pressure or suffering an attack of some variety - so at least if a member of the public or a paramedic can look at my wrist and see what is wrong, then they&rsquo;ll know what to do, or at least who to call &ndash; my Mum,&rdquo; said Darrin.','<p>Walking into his home in Nowra New South Wales, you would have no idea that MedicAlert member Darrin Burgmann even has a medical condition, and yet, this former nurse of nine years has one of the rarest and most debilitating conditions on the planet.<br /><br />Six years ago, while he was still working as a nurse, the now 41-year-old began noticing he was forgetting things and said certain tasks seemed to be becoming more difficult.<br /><br />&ldquo;I really had no idea what was going on, and despite a growing range of bizarre symptoms and an even bigger list of tests I was undertaking, no one had any answers, other than to say &lsquo;you&rsquo;re losing your mind&rsquo; or &lsquo;you must be making this up&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Darrin.<br /><br />&ldquo;While I knew that wasn&rsquo;t true, many of my behaviours - suddenly dropping things, seeing objects, almost blacking out or having my limbs fling out randomly - seemed to suggest something wasn&rsquo;t right.&rdquo;<br /><br />After four years of tests and devastating speculation about his mental state, Darrin was diagnosed with Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) or Shy-Drager Syndrome (SDS) which is a rare degenerative condition resulting from deterioration of certain nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.<br /><br />&ldquo;When I was finally diagnosed in June 2015, I was both relieved and devastated.

In the early hours of Sunday 3 September 2006 Tom was hit by a passing car, leaving the then 19-year-old unconscious and fighting for his life.</p>\r\n<p>With a punctured lung and severe swelling of the brain, amongst other injuries, Tom was left in an induced coma and on life-support.</p>\r\n<p>After a week and just as things seemed on the up, Tom suffered another set back, with massive and unrelieved pressure on the brain causing further damage and leaving doctors with little hope.</p>\r\n<p>To save his life surgeons were forced to perform a bifrontal craniectomy &ndash; removing a large flap of skull to reduce the pressure on his brain. While the procedure was successful, Tom was given slim to no chance of survival, as doctors warned of what his life might be like even if he did wake up.</p>\r\n<p>After 3 weeks in a coma, he started to breathe on his own and his brain began to settle. Over the coming weeks and months, Tom&rsquo;s family were given the shocking news that a third of his brain was dead. But still he endured, and as he woke up to realise he couldn&rsquo;t walk, talk, read, write, understand what people said, remember or even taste, it was evident that Tom&rsquo;s life would never be the same again.</p>\r\n<p>Nine years on and Tom&rsquo;s will to live life to the fullest has seen him fight to regain much of what he lost, including re-enrolling in university, travelling the world and becoming the Co-Chair of &lsquo;Talkback&rsquo; which is the peak body for people living with aphasia in South Australia.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Aphasia is a loss of language skills caused by stroke or other brain injury and continues to be one of the greatest challenges in my life,&rdquo; Tom says.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;In South Australia there are about 10,000 people living with aphasia, and yet it remains a very misunderstood and unknown disorder, largely because those with it struggle to communicate.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As someone with a number of complex and potentially life-threatening conditions, Tom says a MedicAlert membership was a simple choice that gave both he and his mum peace of mind.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to have to stop doing the things I loved, like travel, study and attending social outings, but I also knew that I would be in danger if an emergency struck and the people around me weren&rsquo;t aware of my medical history,&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;As someone who deeply understands the importance of being able to communicate clearly, it&rsquo;s great to know that even if I was caught in an emergency overseas, my medical details would be made available to the people treating me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Tom says he is looking forward to an upcoming trip to Europe, and feels that extra layer of confidence knowing that the MedicAlert emblem is recognised worldwide.</p>\r\n<p>To find out more about the Talkback Association for Aphasia head to <a href=&quot;http://www.aphasia.asn.au/&quot;>http://www.aphasia.asn.au/</a></p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,999,'Thomas Bunning',NULL,NULL,1,0,0,0,0,'/uploads/testimonials/thomas_bunning.png',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,'2016-08-19 10:02:45','2016-10-10 00:35:32',NULL),(93,173,4,0,104,'Skye-Anne Ellard',NULL,NULL,'skye-anne-ellard',0,'Seaford Rise, SA, member since 2009','Never having had morphine before I was looking forward to the near-instant pain relief that had been promised to me, but what I got was certainly unexpected and nowhere near that outcome','<p>As a result of being born prematurely, Skye-Anne Ellard suffered from recurring kidney problems from a young age - and over the years that followed she became very familiar with the hospital system.</p>\r\n<p>As it turns out those experiences must have left their mark, because the now 23-year old Adelaide careworker has turned her attention to carving a career in the health sector, and is currently studying nursing at Flinders University.</p>\r\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until her early teens, however, that she stumbled across the fact that she has a severe &ndash; and potentially fatal &ndash; anaphylaxis to morphine.

Use of Foundation Products</em></p>\r\n<p>6.1 The release of the Member Information to a healthcare provider or emergency services personnel in a medical or other emergency depends on the healthcare provider or emergency services personnel being aware of your Membership emblem.</p>\r\n<p>6.2 You will find information on the Site about how you should wear or display your Membership emblem. It is important that you follow those recommendations. The Foundation devotes considerable effort to promoting awareness amongst healthcare providers and emergency services personnel that in an emergency situation they should check the wrist or neck of a person for evidence of Membership of the Foundation. If the Membership emblem is not displayed in accordance with the recommendations of the Foundation it will greatly reduce the likelihood that the emblem will come to the attention of a healthcare provider or emergency services personnel in an emergency.</p>\r\n<p>6.3 While the Foundation uses all reasonable endeavours to promote and continue awareness of the Foundation amongst healthcare providers and emergency services personnel it does not warrant that even if a Membership emblem is worn in accordance with the recommendations on the Site, it will in every emergency situation be detected by the relevant personnel.</p>\r\n<p><em>7.

It is important that you follow those recommendations. The Foundation devotes considerable effort to promoting awareness amongst healthcare providers and emergency services personnel that in an emergency situation they should check the wrist or neck of a person for evidence of Membership of the Foundation. If the Membership emblem is not displayed in accordance with the recommendations of the Foundation it will greatly reduce the likelihood that the emblem will come to the attention of a healthcare provider or emergency services personnel in an emergency.</p>\r\n<p>6.3 While the Foundation uses all reasonable endeavours to promote and continue awareness of the Foundation amongst healthcare providers and emergency services personnel it does not warrant that even if a Membership emblem is worn in accordance with the recommendations on the Site, it will in every emergency situation be detected by the relevant personnel.</p>\r\n<p><em>7.

The Foundation will use its best endeavours to verify that the person requesting the information is a healthcare provider or emergency services personnel who require immediate access to the Member Information in circumstances where you (or the Member, if you are applying on behalf of another person) are unable to provide it.</p>\r\n<p>5.7 Without limiting any other provisions of these Terms and Conditions, you release the Foundation from any claim by you or for any liability:</p>\r\n<p>a) for loss or damage sustained by you or any other person, arising directly or indirectly as a result of the provision of the Member Information to any person or organisation, if the Member Information is incomplete or inaccurate or out of date due to any act or omission on your part; or</p>\r\n<p>b) if the Member Information is provided to a person or organisation without your consent, provided that the Foundation has reasonable grounds for believing that it was in your interest for the Member Information to be released to that person or organisation, in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>\r\n<p>5.8 If you are making an Application as the parent or guardian of the Member, any reference to &quot;<strong>you</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>your</strong>&quot; in this document is also a reference to the Member unless the context otherwise requires, and you warrant and represent that you are authorised to complete the Application on behalf of the Member and that the information provided is complete and accurate.

Use of Foundation Products</em></p>\r\n<p>6.1 The release of the Member Information to a healthcare provider or emergency services personnel in a medical or other emergency depends on the healthcare provider or emergency services personnel being aware of your Membership emblem.</p>\r\n<p>6.2 You will find information on the Site about how you should wear or display your Membership emblem. It is important that you follow those recommendations. The Foundation devotes considerable effort to promoting awareness amongst healthcare providers and emergency services personnel that in an emergency situation they should check the wrist or neck of a person for evidence of Membership of the Foundation. If the Membership emblem is not displayed in accordance with the recommendations of the Foundation it will greatly reduce the likelihood that the emblem will come to the attention of a healthcare provider or emergency services personnel in an emergency.</p>\r\n<p>6.3 While the Foundation uses all reasonable endeavours to promote and continue awareness of the Foundation amongst healthcare providers and emergency services personnel it does not warrant that even if a Membership emblem is worn in accordance with the recommendations on the Site, it will in every emergency situation be detected by the relevant personnel.</p>\r\n<p><em>7.

Then in 2007 I was in Venice and collapsed and had a seizure. Even the hospital staff weren&rsquo;t sure what was going on during it, even though my sister tried to explain.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I feel a lot safer now with the MedicAlert medical ID and I know that if anything happens, it&rsquo;s there and it can speak for me, if I can&rsquo;t.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Ms Gaffy was diagnosed with tonic clonic epilepsy, as a result of a brain haemorrhage and stroke when she was only 19. Aside from a five minute warning just before the stroke &ndash; a tingling sensation down her right side &ndash; she had no warning signs.</p>\r\n<p>She spent six months in hospital following the stroke and needed 24/7 care to learn to walk, talk and function again. During this time, she had multiple seizures, but now with daily medication she has few seizures a year, but lives in constant fear of having a seizure and is unable to get her driver&rsquo;s licence.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Jones said a MedicAlert medical identification bracelet or necklace plays a critical role in informing first responders in an emergency that a person has a medical condition, particularly when someone is not able to communicate.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;A medical ID can save lives and in the case of children with epilepsy, they also give parents great peace of mind that if something happens when your child is not in your care, they have the protection of a medical ID.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not only are paramedics and healthcare professionals trained to look for the MedicAlert emblem, they can also call the the 24/7 emergency hotline for further important medical and personal details, held on its secure national database.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Epilepsy facts from Epilepsy Action Australia:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>According to the World Health Organisation, epilepsy is the world&rsquo;s most common serious brain disorder.

Then in 2007 I was in Venice and collapsed and had a seizure. Even the hospital staff weren&rsquo;t sure what was going on during it, even though my sister tried to explain.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I feel a lot safer now with the MedicAlert medical ID and I know that if anything happens, it&rsquo;s there and it can speak for me, if I can&rsquo;t.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Ms Gaffy was diagnosed with tonic clonic epilepsy, as a result of a brain haemorrhage and stroke when she was only 19. Aside from a five minute warning just before the stroke &ndash; a tingling sensation down her right side &ndash; she had no warning signs.</p>\r\n<p>She spent six months in hospital following the stroke and needed 24/7 care to learn to walk, talk and function again. During this time, she had multiple seizures, but now with daily medication she has few seizures a year, but lives in constant fear of having a seizure and is unable to get her driver&rsquo;s licence.</p>\r\n<p>Ms Jones said a MedicAlert medical identification bracelet or necklace plays a critical role in informing first responders in an emergency that a person has a medical condition, particularly when someone is not able to communicate.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;A medical ID can save lives and in the case of children with epilepsy, they also give parents great peace of mind that if something happens when your child is not in your care, they have the protection of a medical ID.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Not only are paramedics and healthcare professionals trained to look for the MedicAlert emblem, they can also call the the 24/7 emergency hotline for further important medical and personal details, held on its secure national database.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Epilepsy facts from Epilepsy Action Australia:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>According to the World Health Organisation, epilepsy is the world&rsquo;s most common serious brain disorder.

If it is not, contact the national MedicAlert Foundation immediately.</p>\r\n<p><strong>About Australia MedicAlert Foundation</strong></p>\r\n<p>For over 40 years, Australia Medic Alert Foundation has been the Nation&rsquo;s only not-for-profit organisation providing a 24/7 personal medical emergency information and identification service with close to 300,000 members joining since 1971.</p>\r\n<p>MedicAlert members wear a bracelet or necklace with a genuine MedicAlert emblem custom engraved with their vital medical information, membership number and hotline number.</p>\r\n<p>The 24/7 hotline allows emergency service personnel and healthcare professionals to access important additional medical and other details, such as next of kin, quickly and efficiently in a time of need.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Membership Services Telephone: 1800 88 22 22</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Advertisement in West Australian Newspaper</strong></p>\r\n<p>You can <a href=&quot;https://www.medicalert.org.au/uploads/News/pdf/medicalert_wa_newspaperadvert_sept2014_wed.pdf&quot;

Ms Turner said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ask &ldquo;what matters most?&rdquo; to someone you know and chances are that you&rsquo;ll get a different answer every time &ndash; and for someone with a serious health issue, often what matters most is being able to live a safe and healthy life and MedicAlert membership can certainly help to make that happen.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The <em>Wear What Matters</em> campaign reminds everyone that should they come across someone having a seizure, is incoherent or unconscious and isn&rsquo;t able to say what is wrong with them, to check around the neck and wrist points for the easily recognisable MedicAlert logo for potentially life-saving medical information.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Ms Turner said that too often people join MedicAlert Foundation after they or a loved one have survived a near-miss event and encouraged people to become more proactive with their health management and not leave it until such a close-call.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We also want to remind our existing members that have stopped wearing their emblem for some reason to put it back on &ndash; and better still to not to take it off at all,&rdquo; Ms Turner said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is also a timely reminder for members to check emblems for wear and confirm and update their details held on file to ensure they are provided with the best possible assistance when it is most needed,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Having a medical condition doesn&rsquo;t need to hold anyone back from living life to the fullest and when it comes to wearing what matters, the reality is that we &ndash; MedicAlert Foundation &ndash;

Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, can usually be prevented, or its onset can at least be delayed.

Type 2 diabetes usually occurs in older adults, however, growing numbers of younger people, including children, are now contracting the disease.</p>\r\n<p>Family history and issues like high blood pressure and body shape may determine risk levels but lifestyle factors also play a significant part. In a society where more people are overweight or obese, are not physically active and have poor diets, we are seeing an unprecedented number of diabetes cases that never should have occurred.</p>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re living with the disease it&rsquo;s important to take control; playing an active role in the self-management of the condition is this first step. A vital part of your management plan should include identifying yourself as someone living with diabetes. A MedicAlert medical ID is a great tool in this regard. It can alert those who come to assist you in an emergency to your condition and provides first responders with the immediate information they need to assist in ensuring appropriate medical assistance is administered.</p>\r\n<p>8&ndash;14 July 2012 is Diabetes Awareness Week, a week dedicated to increasing awareness of diabetes in our community, how it can be prevented and effective ways to live with and manage the disease.

There seems to be conflicting ideas as food allergies are often confused with food intolerances. A food allergy can be described as &lsquo;the immune system&rsquo;s response to a protein in food that the body mistakenly believes is harmful<sup>2</sup>&rsquo;. On contact with the protein, the immune system releases large amounts of chemicals which can affect a person&rsquo;s breathing, gastrointestinal tract, skin and even heart<sup>2</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>Signs that someone has had an allergic reaction to food include hives, welts or body redness, vomiting, tingling in the mouth, difficulty breathing, swelling of the eyes, lips, face or tongue, wheezing and difficulty talking. Children affected by food allergies may also appear pale and floppy<sup>2</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>The most extreme form of reaction is called anaphylaxis, a generalised allergic reaction involving more than one body system. Anaphylaxis usually occurs within 20 minutes to two hours of exposure to the trigger and can rapidly become life threatening<sup>2</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>The most common food allergy triggers for children are eggs, milk, peanuts and tree nuts. Other triggers (for people of all ages) include fish, shellfish, sesame, soy and wheat. Even kiwi fruit, banana, chicken, mustard and celery are known to have caused severe allergic reactions. There are over 170 foods that have been linked to food allergies and for each person affected the response can be different<sup>2</sup>. Unfortunately there is no cure but prevention and immediate treatment in the case of exposure to those triggers are vital.</p>\r\n<p>Whenever a person experiences an allergic reaction to food, no matter how mild, it is important they receive prompt medical attention. While fatalities are reasonably rare, serious reactions are all too common and you must be properly equipped to manage any type of reaction.</p>\r\n<p>MedicAlert membership is a great tool in assisting people with food allergies to take control. A MedicAlert medical ID is engraved with your personal medical information, including any allergies and illnesses, your membership number and a 24/7 hotline number. In an emergency, those who&rsquo;ve come to assist can easily access your details, identify the risk and provide the most appropriate medical attention.

But did you know that MedicAlert Foundation can also advise of your wishes regarding organ and tissue donation at the most critical time? <br /> <br /> Whether you choose to communicate your donation wishes via your bracelet, necklace or just on your membership card, MedicAlert provides an immediate and effective way to inform emergency services personnel of your decision to save and improve lives. But first, you must register your donation decision on the <a href=&quot;http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/public/services/aodr/index.jsp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Australian Organ Donor Register</a> and, most importantly, you must discuss your donation decision with your family. <br /> <br /> &ldquo;In 2011, 1001 Australians and their families benefited from the legacy of 337 of their fellow Australians who last year became organ donors,&rdquo; said Dr Jonathan Gillis, National Medical Director of the Organ and Tissue Authority. However, the Authority emphasises that many more people could have been helped if the families of willing donors knew of their loved ones&rsquo; desire to donate. <br /> <br /> You see, in Australia the family is always asked to confirm the donation wishes of the deceased before donation or transplantation can proceed. While many Australians are prepared to be organ and tissue donors, the family consent rate is less than 60%. <br /> <br /> DonateLife Week, held this year between 19&ndash;26 February, is part of the Australian Government&rsquo;s national awareness campaign to increase family discussion about donation wishes. Since the reform began just over two years ago, Australia has achieved the highest ever number of donors and transplant recipients. <br /> <br /> During DonateLife Week, all Australians will be encouraged to ask and know their loved ones&rsquo; donation wishes . Sure, it&rsquo;s a difficult topic to bring up, but it&rsquo;s important that you do so. <br /> <br /> For some great suggestions on how to start a conversation about organ and tissue donation or to find out more about becoming a donor yourself, visit <a href=&quot;http://www.donatelife.gov.au%20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>donatelife.gov.au.</a><br /> <br /> This month MedicAlert Foundation is encouraging you to communicate your wishes with your family first and then with us.

It&rsquo;s not uncommon to hear that the same food that can solve heart disease according to one organisation might also cause heart issues according to another. So what&rsquo;s the truth?</p>\r\n<p>Well, as it stands heart disease is the leading cause of death in Australia, but with a healthy blend of exercise, the right lifestyle choices (no smoking) and a balanced diet packed full of the following foods you can make sure you don&rsquo;t add to this statistic.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h3><strong>1. SALMON</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Salmon and other oily fish such as sardines and mackerel are the superstars of heart-healthy foods. That&#039;s because they contain large amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to slow the build up of artery-clogging plaque, lower blood triglyceride levels, reduce the risk of irregular heartbeats, and lower blood pressure. The National Heart Foundation of Australia recommends eating 2-3 serves of fish a week (100-150g per serve).</p>\r\n<p><br /><img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/news-and-resources/newsletter/salmon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;salmon.jpg (85 KB)&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; /><br /><br /></p>\r\n<h3><strong>2. BLUEBERRIES</strong></h3>\r\n<p>The brighter the better. All colurful fruits and vegetables contain phytonutrients and offer health benefits, but dark-skinned blueberries are especially high in disease-fighting antioxidants that can help prevent heart disease.</p>\r\n<p><strong><img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/news-and-resources/newsletter/blueberry.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;blueberry.jpg (64 KB)&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; /><br /><br />3. OATS</strong></p>\r\n<p>Oats are high in soluble fibre, which can lower cholesterol. Soluble fibre acts like a sponge in the digestive tract and soaks up the cholesterol so it is eliminated from the body and not absorbed into the bloodstream. Tip: Try avoiding instant oats, which often contain sugar, and look instead for old-fashioned or even quick-cooking oats.</p>\r\n<p> <img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/news-and-resources/newsletter/oats.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;oats.jpg (89 KB)&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; /></p>\r\n<h3><strong><br />4. BLACK BEANS</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Beans and other legumes are rich in protein, high in soluble fibre, and contain no saturated fat. Enjoy any variety of beans, chickpeas, or lentils, but black beans get extra points for heart-healthy antioxidants. Tip: Use beans instead of beef for your next Mexican feast.</p>\r\n<p><img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/news-and-resources/newsletter/blackbeans.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;blackbeans.jpg (91 KB)&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; /> </p>\r\n<h3><strong><br />5. WALNUTS</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Nuts are a great source of healthy fats, antioxidants, and fibre. A small handful of nuts makes a great snack once a day and will help you to reduce the risk of developing heart disease. Walnuts are the highest in omega-3s, but almonds, hazelnuts, and pistachios are also healthy and tasty choices.</p>\r\n<p> <img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/news-and-resources/newsletter/walnut.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walnut.jpg (79 KB)&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; /></p>\r\n<h3><strong><br />6. KALE</strong></h3>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re into healthy foods you&rsquo;ve probably heard of the term &lsquo;kale&rsquo; and for good reason. The dark crinkled leaves contain antioxidants, fibre, and a range of valuable vitamins and minerals that have been shown to support heart health. Don&rsquo;t like kale? Spinach, beet greens, Swiss chard, turnip greens, and collards are good for you too.</p>\r\n<p> <img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/news-and-resources/newsletter/kale.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;kale.jpg (104 KB)&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; /></p>\r\n<h3><strong><br />7. AVOCADO</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Avocadoes are a great alternative to traditional spreads like butter. Each avocado is packed with over 14 minerals, 18 essential amino acids (protein) and more potassium than a banana, which can help regulate blood pressure. They also contain monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, folate and fibre, making it a heart-healthy powerhouse. Tip: Use avocado on your sandwich instead of butter or mayonnaise.</p>\r\n<p> <img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/news-and-resources/newsletter/avocado.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;avocado.jpg (108 KB)&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; /></p>\r\n<h3><strong><br />8.</strong> <strong>EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL</strong></h3>\r\n<p>There are endless healthy reasons to make extra-virgin olive oil your first choice for cooking. To begin with, olive oil contains monounsaturated &lsquo;good fats&rsquo; that can help reduce your LDL cholesterol levels. Extra-virgin varieties also contain antioxidants, for an added pick me up.</p>\r\n<p> <img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/news-and-resources/newsletter/olivoil.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;olivoil.jpg (87 KB)&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; /></p>\r\n<h3><strong><br />9. TOFU</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Tofu, made from soybean curds, is naturally gluten-free, low in calories, contains no cholesterol and is an excellent source of protein, iron, and calcium. Countless studies have suggested that increasing consumption of plant-based foods like tofu, decreases the risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and promotes a healthy complexion and hair, increased energy, and overall lower weight &ndash; all of which are great for your heart. Tip: Use tofu in the place of meat once a week.</p>\r\n<p> <img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/news-and-resources/newsletter/tofo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tofo.jpg (89 KB)&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; /></p>\r\n<p><strong><br />10. WHOLE GRAIN BREAD</strong></p>\r\n<p>Scrap white bread (which is often full of sugar and salt) and choose something packed full of grains and linseeds - which are a great source of healthy fats. Eating grain foods, mostly wholegrains, can help protect against heart disease and other chronic diseases, like type 2 diabetes and some cancers. We also recommend choosing breads lower in salt, which is listed as sodium in the nutrition information panel on food labels. Check the per 100g column in the panel, and choose breads with sodium of 400mg or less per 100g, and fibre of 4g or more per 100g.</p>\r\n<p><img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/news-and-resources/newsletter/bread.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bread.jpg (81 KB)&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; /><br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>For more information, tips and heart healthy recipes visit <a href=&quot;http://heartfoundation.org.au/healthy-eating&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>http://heartfoundation.org.au/healthy-eating<br /><br /><br /></a><a href=&quot;http://heartfoundation.org.au/healthy-eating&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;><br /></a></p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,999,'10 foods that could save your heart',NULL,NULL,1,0,0,0,0,'/uploads/news-and-resources/images/medic-alert-logo.jpg',NULL,NULL,'2016-04-01','2020-12-31',NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,'2016-10-13 18:50:05','2018-01-31 07:13:08',NULL),(238,673,2,0,17,'Does the coach know?',NULL,NULL,'does-the-coach-know',0,NULL,'<h1> </h1>\r\n<p><img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/news-and-resources/newsletter/coach.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;coach.jpg (97 KB)&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; />It&rsquo;s that time of year where you&rsquo;re probably running from shop to shop trying to find the right boots, bibs and balls for the winter sports season. This means it&rsquo;s also a great time to remind your coach of any pre-existing medical conditions, allergies or medications &ndash; the type you might list on your MedicAlert medical ID &ndash; because the more people that know how to treat you in an emergency, the safer you&rsquo;ll be.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>A great way to ensure your coach or team manager is aware of your relevant medical history is to provide them with a copy of your wallet card. Describe what the wallet card does and that emergency services need to be made aware of this information in an emergency situation.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>And remember, while sport is a great way to keep fit and healthy, it also provides a few additional dangers you should be aware of. Firstly, your chances of becoming unconscious and unable to speak in an emergency are increased, with pain, exhaustion or concussion often leading to a lack of consciousness. Added to this is the fact that you&rsquo;ll often be asked to remove your MedicAlert jewellery prior to a game to avoid injuring yourself or other players, so it becomes even more important to make sure your coach or team manager is aware of your medical history.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>And don&rsquo;t forget, if you do take off your medical ID before each game; remember to put it back on afterwards.</em></strong></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>So, as you rush to get that last minute sports shopping done we wish you good luck for the season ahead &ndash; let&rsquo;s make sure it&rsquo;s a safe one.<br /><br /><br /></p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,999,'Does the coach know?',NULL,NULL,1,0,0,0,0,'/uploads/news-and-resources/images/medic-alert-logo.jpg',NULL,NULL,'2016-04-01','2020-12-31',NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,'2016-10-13 18:51:47','2018-01-31 07:13:08',NULL),(239,674,2,0,17,'Our new best seller',NULL,NULL,'our-new-best-seller',0,NULL,'<h1> </h1>\r\n<p><img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/news-and-resources/newsletter/steel_wristband_tag_h_on_activity_tracker_black_mar16_copy1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;steel_wristband_tag_h_on_activity_tracker_black_mar16_copy1.jpg (786 KB)&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; />Exercise is important, and we know that a short run, evening stroll or gut-wrenching gym workout can help with a number of medical conditions we see our members living with, so in March this year we released a new silicone wristband tag that will keep you safe while you get your sweat on.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The new all-purpose emblem style is designed to provide you with protection and peace of mind no matter where you may wish to walk, run, climb or hike.

Studies show that heart attack survivors who have participated in a cardiac rehabilitation program have a greater chance of avoiding a second event. In fact they are 40% less likely to be readmitted to hospital and 25% less likely to die from another heart attack.</p>\r\n<p class=&quot;p1&quot;>So this Heart Week, have a conversation with your doctor, and call the Heart Foundation Health Information Service on 1300 36 27 87 &ndash; they can help you find your local cardiac rehabilitation program.</p>\r\n<p class=&quot;p1&quot;>And remember, if you are suffering from a heart condition, please speak to your doctor about how MedicAlert can help keep you safe in an emergency.</p>\r\n<p class=&quot;p1&quot;> </p>\r\n<p class=&quot;p2&quot;><span class=&quot;s1&quot;>For more information visit <a href=&quot;http://www.heartfoundation.org.au/heartweek&quot;>www.heartfoundation.org.au/heartweek<br /></a><br /></span></p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,999,'Stop heart attacks in their tracks',NULL,NULL,1,0,0,0,0,'/uploads/news-and-resources/images/medic-alert-logo.jpg',NULL,NULL,'2016-04-01','2020-12-31',NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,'2016-10-13 18:56:12','2018-01-31 07:13:08',NULL),(241,676,2,0,17,'Speak for yourself',NULL,NULL,'speak-for-yourself',0,NULL,'<p><img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/news-and-resources/newsletter/speak_for_yourself2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;speak_for_yourself2.jpg (65 KB)&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; height=&quot;182&quot; />While MedicAlert medical IDs are largely there to help keep you safe in any emergency that may render you unable to communicate, if you find yourself in an emergency where you are able to speak you should always advise treating healthcare professionals that your medical information is kept on file through MedicAlert, who also offer a 24/7 Emergency Response Service should they need to contact us.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>If you are conscious when paramedics reach you, we would advise you to show them your medical ID and hand them your wallet card, both of which will allow them to access your full medical and personal information available on your personal file.

Preheat oven to 190&deg;C (170&deg;C fan-forced).<br /><br />2. Lightly grease a shallow-sided, non-stick oven tray with cooking spray. Arrange the fish fillets in a single layer over the prepared tray and drizzle with a squeeze of lemon juice.<br /><br />3. Mix together the cream cheese, mustard, chives and lemon rind and spread mixture over fish fillets.<br /><br />4. Spray 1 filo sheet with cooking spray, fold in half, reapply cooking spray then fold in half again. Cut layered filo into quarters. Gently scrunch up the filo pieces, place over one fish fillet and reapply cooking spray. Repeat with remaining filo to cover all fish fillets.<br /><br />5. Bake in preheated oven for 15-20 minutes until filo is golden and fish is cooked through.<br /><br />6.

So how can allergy sufferers stay safe and avoid missing out on socialising outdoors?</p>\r\n<p><img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; title=&quot;allergy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.medicalert.org.au/uploads/News/images/allergy_shot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;allergy&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; /></p>\r\n<p>7. <strong>Know your enemy.</strong> Pollen is the most common cause of increased allergy activity in spring, with around 15% of Australians suffering hayfever during this period. So what exactly is pollen? Pollen is the microscopic grains produced by the male parts of the plant when it flowers. These tiny particles are typically released in the morning and are spread by birds, bees or wind, in order to reproduce.</p>\r\n<p>Pollen and other &#039;allergens&#039;, irritate the lining of the sensitive nasal passages, inflaming them and causing them to secrete fluids. They can also cause other allergic conditions like watery eyes, itchiness and asthma.</p>\r\n<p><br />6. <strong>Which plants produce the most pollen?</strong> While we may notice them more, most beautiful and bright flowering plants (like the infamous wattle) actually don&rsquo;t need to produce as much pollen because it is often carried to other plants by birds and bees, where as other more common plants such as grasses produce huge amounts of pollen because they rely on wind to spread it.</p>\r\n<p><br />The Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy says the most significant causes of hayfever during spring in the southern states are temperate grasses - particularly ryegrass, which can affect people who are a long way from the source.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>5. <strong>Know if it is a cold or an allergy.</strong> Hayfever, another term for allergic rhinitis, commonly presents itself like a cold or the flu, which can be confusing since the spring allergy season and flu season overlap. However, there is a definite distinction between these conditions. In general, allergy symptoms kick in fast (as opposed to over the course of a few days), linger for longer than a week, don&rsquo;t include fever and aches, and involve a runny nose with clear mucus. Allergies cannot be cured, but they can be treated in numerous ways, such as taking over-the-counter and prescription medications, minimising contact with allergens, and managing one&rsquo;s environment.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>4. <strong>Clean, clean, clean.</strong> Common everyday items are the most likely things to trigger an allergic reaction, which means cleaning everything from your clothes to your bed sheets is critical to avoiding reactions. Tricks such as adding bicarbonate of soda or vinegar to the washing machine to get rid of excess detergent residue can be helpful, while investing in dust mite covers for your bed and pillows is a must. If possible, also consider making your bedroom a pet-free zone and replace carpets with hardwood floors.</p>\r\n<p><br />3. <strong>Utilise technology. </strong>Like the weather, allergies also have a forecast, and these days there are a number of useful apps and websites that can help you track and manage your allergies before they really flare up. Both the Weather Zone Pollen Index <a href=&quot;http://www.weatherzone.com.au/pollen-index/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>website</a> and <a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/weatherzone/id409060691?mt=8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>APP</a>, as well as <a href=&quot;http://www.accuweather.com/en/au/australia-weather&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>accuweather.com</a>(via their allergies tab) offer great insights into the daily pollen count and other useful facts.</p>\r\n<p><br />2. <strong>Changing your daily routine.</strong> If your allergies are triggered by seasonal changes, such as more exposure to plant pollen in the spring or additional mould and dust mites in winter, then you may need to change with the seasons. Basically, you want to reduce your exposure to the allergens when they&rsquo;re at their peak and remove them from your environment as much as possible. This may include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Only going outdoors after 11am (or at low pollen times indicated by the above apps).</li>\r\n<li>Changing your clothes and shoes when you walk through the door so you don&rsquo;t bring allergens into the house.</li>\r\n<li>Dusting early in the day to give dust time to settle before you settle down in the evening.</li>\r\n<li>Showering at night to get rid of the pollen you&rsquo;ve picked up all day so you&rsquo;re not breathing it in all night long.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Before we get to number one&hellip;</strong> did you know that MedicAlert has been recognised and recommended by the World Allergy Organisation as a valuable preventative tool to use to support your allergies and alert service to speak for you in an emergency.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>1. <strong>Knowledge is power.</strong> The most important first step is to find out exactly what you&rsquo;re allergic to, otherwise you simply won&rsquo;t be able to treat it and you&rsquo;ll keep suffering. Try keeping a journal so you can pinpoint your allergy triggers, whether it&rsquo;s environmental (a certain tree, road or building) or a specific food. And remember, while there are some over the counter medications that may work for some, if symptoms persist see your GP or get tested by an allergist.</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,999,'Defeating allergies this spring',NULL,NULL,1,0,0,0,0,'/uploads/news-and-resources/images/medic-alert-logo.jpg',NULL,NULL,'2016-08-01','2020-12-31',NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,'2016-10-13 19:13:42','2018-01-31 07:13:08',NULL),(249,684,2,0,17,'Better than the rest',NULL,NULL,'better-than-the-rest',0,NULL,'<p><img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/news-and-resources/newsletter/medicalertbracelet.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;medicalertbracelet.jpg (16 KB)&quot; width=&quot;290&quot; height=&quot;181&quot; />You may never see her, but chances are that if you are caught in a medical emergency and you&rsquo;re wearing your MedicAlert medical ID, then Dr Sarah LePage&rsquo;s expertise could be the difference between life and death.</p>\r\n<p>As our resident clinical expert, Dr LePage assist to ensure that all our engraving meets standard abbreviations and best practice in healthcare communication, General Practitioner Dr LePage says it is critical to have such quality control processes in place.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;What use is a MedicAlert bracelet if it doesn&rsquo;t have the correct description of a condition or if the wording is not easily understood by emergency responders!?&rdquo; says Dr LePage.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my job to oversee what people are engraving on their medical ID&rsquo;s and to make sure that MedicAlert&rsquo;s membership services staff and all emergency and healthcare professionals understand exactly what those engravings mean.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>While other medical identification organisations allow their members to engrave anything they want, Dr LePage says she is proud to work with an organisation that is committed to ensuring that even a member of the public can understand and act on engravings.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;If someone is lost and wondering in the street and suddenly you see on their bracelet that they have &lsquo;Dementia&rsquo;, memory loss and &lsquo;Contact details&rsquo; listed on their medical ID, then suddenly anyone can act on that situation and help protect that person,&rdquo; says Dr LePage.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I guess my other focus is ensuring that MedicAlert membership services staff are also aware of standard medical abbreviations, and also rare conditions and engravings we are confronted with from time to time. Because at the end of the day this level of quality control is what keeps people safe and can give true peace of mind to members.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>While we can&rsquo;t always avoid an emergency, Dr LePage says it is reassuring to know that first responders are also being taught how to find, interpret and act on the information she oversees on engravings.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the final step of the process that really makes a difference when every second counts &ndash; if our products are is easy to find and the person&rsquo;s information is readily available, then that&rsquo;s going to help a lot,&rdquo; says Dr LePage.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly how many lives we&rsquo;ve saved, but if it&rsquo;s even a handful, then that&rsquo;s something to be proud of, because without this quality control process we have at MedicAlert then perhaps some people would fall through the cracks and healthcare professionals wouldn&rsquo;t be able to respond as quickly, or in the right way, in an emergency.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Dr LePage is responsible for reviewing all MedicAlert engravings for new members who join and their have not had their application authenticated by a GP.

The Operators will be able to hear the user and other happenings in the home; and they will ask how they can best help.

But from these humble beginnings, where our &lsquo;product range&rsquo; included one stainless steel option, we&rsquo;ve now grown to offer a suite of more trendy and fashionable yet distinctly recognisable bracelets, necklaces and wristbands made from leather, gold, gemstones, silicone, silver, pearls and more.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>While we couldn&rsquo;t be more proud of our range of products, services and technical advancements, such as our brand new website (which will be launched very soon), it is still the stories of how this progress actually helps our members that truly matters. In fact, as we&rsquo;ve spent time reflecting on just how far we have come in the last 45 years, there is one thing that stands out above all others, and that is the 365,000 mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, daughters and sons we have supported, protected and saved. The membership records generated by MedicAlert which can be accessed by emergency personnel and our recognised products has saved thousands of lives.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>People like Kurt Byers, who suffered anaphylaxis at a work function as a result of his severe dairy allergy. The then 35-year-old explained that he might not be here today if not for what happened next.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was struggling to speak and couldn&rsquo;t tell hospital staff what was wrong with me. While they knew it was some sort of reaction they didn&rsquo;t know why &ndash; but I was able to show them my MedicAlert and they immediately gave me the right treatment for my condition,&rdquo; said Kurt.  </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>From allergies to some of the rarest conditions, MedicAlert has always prided itself on protecting Australians from any and every condition under the sun. Take West Australian mum Fiona Smith for example. Since she was diagnosed with &lsquo;von Willebrand&rsquo; - a rare bleeding disorder she discovered while giving birth to her son &ndash; Fiona says MedicAlert has helped her to escape two very close calls.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I have been rushed to hospital twice and on both occasions my MedicAlert membership has let the ambulance crew know immediately so they administer the right treatment,&rdquo; said Fiona.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not only the lives we&rsquo;ve saved and protected, it&rsquo;s also the lives we&rsquo;ve transformed. Take for instance Peter Richards, a Parkinson&rsquo;s sufferer who&rsquo;d undergone surgery that meant he had metal electrodes implanted in his head and a battery pack in his chest. As an avid traveller, Peter was heart broken after his operation, as he felt his days of exploring the world might be numbered. But thanks to the support from our friendly staff that fear of being trapped was soon replaced with jubilation.   </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;In the wrong situation my implants could pose significant health risks, so it&rsquo;s great to have that peace of mind that comes with wearing a MedicAlert medical ID. And actually, it&rsquo;s allowed us to travel to Asia with confidence, not once or twice, but five times since I had the surgery.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>So while we&rsquo;re proud to boast an incredible array of products and services that utilise the very latest technology, our greatest achievement will always be allowing our members to live long, productive and independent lives.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>So hip, hip, hooray and here&rsquo;s to another 45 years of service, innovation and keeping you safe!!!</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>OUR SPECIAL OFFER &ndash; As you&rsquo;ve just read, this October marks MedicAlert Foundation&#039;s 45th birthday in Australia, so to celebrate this milestone, we&#039;re giving away a free limited edition MedicAlert key ring when you purchase any new medical ID during the month of October.

This of course, may lead to treatment being provided to you that does not align with your wishes.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>To solve this problem, you may wish to utilise MedicAlert&rsquo;s <a href=&quot;https://www.medicalert.org.au/Advance_Care_Directive_Management_Service&quot;>Advance Care Directive Management Service</a>, which means all your written Advance Care Directives will be safely and confidentially stored, communicated, and made available when and where they are needed.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>This service, exclusive to members, includes:</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Securely holding your Advance Care Directive(s)</li>\r\n<li>Engraving on your medical ID stating you have an Advance Care Directive</li>\r\n<li>An emergency wallet card stating you have an Advance Care Directive on file</li>\r\n<li>24/7 Emergency Response Service service for the medical team to access the directive</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong>What exactly is an Advance Care Directive (ACD)?</strong></p>\r\n<p>An Advance Care Directive is a written document, intended to apply to future periods of impaired decision-making capacity, which provides a legal means for a competent adult to instruct a Substitute Decision Maker and/or to record preferences for future health and personal care. ACDs are not clinical care or treatment plans, but clinical care or treatment plans can and should be informed by ACDs. It is important to note that verbally communicated instructions and values also hold weight.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>ACDs can take many forms, and laws regarding <a href=&quot;https://www.medicalert.org.au/Advance_Care_Planning_Resources&quot;>ACDs are different in each state</a>. You should be aware of the laws in your state prior to creating your advance directive.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Although often about end-of-life care (the last 12 months) or terminal care (the last days to weeks of life), a person may also wish to complete an ACD for other reasons (for example, there may be some treatment the patient would never wish to receive) or simply for peace of mind in case of unexpected illness or injury.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Should I have an Advance Care Directive?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Yes. By creating an Advanced Care Directive, you are making your preferences about medical care known before you&rsquo;re faced with a serious injury or illness. Even if you are in good health, you should consider having an ACD. An accident or serious illness can happen suddenly, and if you already have a signed ACD, your wishes are more likely to be followed.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Upload Your Advance Care Directive</strong></p>\r\n<p>Secure and safe storage of Advanced Health Care Directives is available to <a href=&quot;https://www.medicalert.org.au/Membership/Membership_Benefits&quot;>members of MedicAlert</a>.

No further discounts/offers apply.</h6>','<h2>Why do seniors need medical jewellery?</h2>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a senior living with a medical condition, medical jewellery could mean the difference between life or death in an emergency. It can speak for you when you can&rsquo;t communicate your needs or condition and will provide your loved ones with piece of mind. Medical alert jewellery helps emergency responders and other first aid workers within the community assist you faster.
